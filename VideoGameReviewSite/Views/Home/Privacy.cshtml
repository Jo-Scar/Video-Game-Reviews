<p>
    The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May of 2018. One of the reasons that the EU introduced the law is to give people more control over their personal data.

    To prepare for the GDPR, companies have had to think carefully about their data protection and privacy practices.

    One of the most important requirements for companies that fall under the scope of the GDPR is that they provide transparent and accessible information about the personal data they're processing. The way to do this is by having a clear and comprehensive Privacy Policy.
